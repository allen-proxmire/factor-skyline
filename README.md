# The Factor Skyline: An Ontological Lookout Over the Integers

A structural and geometric reinterpretation of the integers that reveals the hidden architecture behind divisibility, factorization, and prime behavior.  
This repository hosts the manuscript, supporting notes, and related materials for the Factor Skyline framework.

## Overview

The **Factor Skyline** is an ontological model of the integers.  
It treats each integer not as a point on a line, but as a *column* with:

- **width** determined by its least prime factor  
- **height** determined by its quotient  
- **activation layers** at prime squares  
- **coverage** representing divisibility  
- **escape events** representing primality  

This geometric representation exposes the structural logic behind sieve behavior, prime thinning, and the apparent “randomness” of primes — all without invoking analytic machinery.

This project is not a new analytic theory of primes.  
It is a **structural ontology**: a new way of seeing the integers that makes familiar number‑theoretic phenomena visually and conceptually inevitable.

## Purpose and Scope

The Factor Skyline aims to:

- reveal the hidden geometric structure of the integers  
- unify sieve logic and factorization geometry  
- reinterpret prime behavior as structural “escape”  
- challenge the one‑dimensional projection of the number line  
- provide a contemplative vista for understanding multiplicative depth  

This is a philosophical and structural project, not a theorem‑producing analytic framework.

## Key Ideas

- **The number line is a projection** that collapses multiplicative structure.  
- **The skyline restores depth**, making divisibility visible.  
- **Prime squares act as activation thresholds**, shaping the global geometry.  
- **Coverage layers** correspond to sieve removal.  
- **Primes appear as escape points**, not statistical anomalies.  

These ideas are developed in detail in the manuscript.
