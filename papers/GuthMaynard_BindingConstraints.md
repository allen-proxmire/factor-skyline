# Binding Constraints After Guth–Maynard: A Structural Analysis of the EXPDB Pipeline

## Abstract

We report the results of running the Tao–Trudgian–Yang Exponent Database (EXPDB) pipeline with the Guth–Maynard (2024) large value estimate incorporated. Using a scipy-based replacement for the pycddlib polytope backend, we compute the full piecewise zero-density function $A(\sigma)$ from 482 literature hypotheses, confirm the prime gap exponent $\theta_{\mathrm{PNTALL}} = 17/30$, and perform a complete binding-constraint and sensitivity analysis. The binding point is a cusp at $\sigma^* = 7/10$ where the Ingham (1940) and Guth–Maynard (2024) zero-density curves meet. For $\theta_{\mathrm{PNTALL}}$, the bottleneck is purely in the large-value projection; the energy exponent $A^*(\sigma)$ is irrelevant. For $\theta_{\mathrm{GAPSQUARE}}$, the bottleneck is split equally between the large-value and energy projections.

## 1. Setup and Definitions

We work within the EXPDB framework of Tao, Trudgian, and Yang [TTY25]. The master polytope $\mathcal{P} \subset \mathbb{R}^5$ lives in coordinates $(\sigma, \tau, \rho, \rho^*, s)$. The pipeline descends:

$$
\mathcal{P} \;\xrightarrow{\;\pi\;}\; R_{\mathrm{LV}} \subset \mathbb{R}^3 \;\xrightarrow{\;\sup\;}\; A(\sigma) \;\xrightarrow{\;\sup_\sigma\;}\; \|A\|_\infty \;\xrightarrow{\;\text{Ingham}\;}\; \theta.
$$

The zero-density function $A(\sigma)$ satisfies $N(\sigma, T) \leq T^{A(\sigma) + \varepsilon}$, where $N(\sigma, T)$ counts zeros of $\zeta(s)$ with real part $\geq \sigma$ and imaginary part $\leq T$. The prime gap exponent is

$$
\theta_{\mathrm{PNTALL}} \leq 1 - \frac{1}{\|A\|_\infty}, \qquad \|A\|_\infty := \sup_{1/2 \leq \sigma \leq 1} A(\sigma).
$$

The mean-square gap exponent satisfies

$$
\theta_{\mathrm{GAPSQUARE}} \leq \max\!\left(2 - \frac{2}{\|A\|_\infty},\; \sup_\sigma \max(\alpha(\sigma), \beta(\sigma))\right),
$$

where $\alpha(\sigma) = 4\sigma - 2 + 2(B(\sigma)(1-\sigma)-1)/(B(\sigma)-A(\sigma))$, $\;\beta(\sigma) = 4\sigma - 2 + (B(\sigma)(1-\sigma)-1)/A(\sigma)$, and $B(\sigma) \geq A^*(\sigma)$ is the zero-density energy exponent.

## 2. Updated Exponents

Running the EXPDB pipeline with the full literature set (482 hypotheses, including all Guth–Maynard constraints and the Tao–Trudgian–Yang derived estimates), we obtain:

$$
\|A\|_\infty = \frac{30}{13} \approx 2.3077, \qquad \sigma^* = \frac{7}{10},
$$

$$
\theta_{\mathrm{PNTALL}} = 1 - \frac{13}{30} = \frac{17}{30} \approx 0.5667.
$$

The improvement over the pre-Guth–Maynard value is

$$
\Delta\theta = \frac{7}{12} - \frac{17}{30} = \frac{35 - 34}{60} = \frac{1}{60} \approx 0.0167.
$$

## 3. The Cusp at $\sigma = 7/10$

The function $A(\sigma)$ is piecewise-rational on approximately 40 intervals. Its global supremum is achieved at a cusp where two zero-density estimates meet:

**Left limb.** For $\sigma \in [1/2, 7/10)$, the binding estimate is Ingham (1940):

$$
A_{\mathrm{Ing}}(\sigma) = \frac{3}{2 - \sigma}.
$$

This is an increasing, concave-up function of $\sigma$.

**Right limb.** For $\sigma \in [7/10, 19/25)$, the binding estimate is Guth–Maynard (2024):

$$
A_{\mathrm{GM}}(\sigma) = \frac{15}{5\sigma + 3}.
$$

This is a decreasing, concave-down function of $\sigma$.

At $\sigma = 7/10$, both evaluate to the same value:

$$
A_{\mathrm{Ing}}(7/10) = \frac{3}{2 - 7/10} = \frac{3}{13/10} = \frac{30}{13}, \qquad A_{\mathrm{GM}}(7/10) = \frac{15}{5 \cdot 7/10 + 3} = \frac{15}{13/2} = \frac{30}{13}.
$$

The supremum $\|A\|_\infty = 30/13$ is attained at this crossover. The function $A(\sigma)$ has a non-smooth peak — a cusp formed by two rational curves meeting tangentially from opposite sides. Before Guth–Maynard, the analogous cusp was at $\sigma \approx 5/7 \approx 0.714$, where Ingham met Huxley at $\|A\|_\infty = 12/5$. Guth–Maynard shifted the cusp leftward (from $5/7$ to $7/10$) and downward (from $12/5$ to $30/13$).

## 4. Binding and Slack Constraints

### Binding at $\sigma^*$

| Rank | Constraint | Interval | $A(\sigma^*)$ | Status |
|------|-----------|----------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | Guth–Maynard (2024) | $[7/10, \, 19/25)$ | $30/13$ | **Binding** |
| 2 | Ingham (1940) | $[1/2, \, 7/10)$ | $30/13$ | **Binding** |

These are the only two constraints that determine $\|A\|_\infty$. They meet at $\sigma^* = 7/10$ and are jointly binding.

### Locally binding (away from $\sigma^*$)

The following estimates are binding on their respective subintervals of $(1/2, 1)$ but produce $A(\sigma) < 30/13$ there, so they do not affect $\|A\|_\infty$:

| Estimate | Binding interval | $A$ at midpoint |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Ivic (2003) | $[19/25, \sim 0.78)$ | $\sim 2.21$ |
| Tao–Trudgian–Yang (2024) | $[\sim 0.78, \sim 0.90)$ | $\sim 2.01$ |
| Ivic (1980) | $[0.80, 0.88)$ | $\sim 1.88$ |
| Derived (Bourgain EP) | $[\sim 0.92, \sim 0.98)$ | $\sim 1.09$ |
| Pintz (2023) | $[\sim 0.96, 1)$ | $\sim 0.71$ |

### Completely slack

The following estimates are strictly dominated by the binding estimates at every $\sigma$:

| Estimate | Previous $\|A\|_\infty$ | Slack at $\sigma^*$ |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Huxley (1972) | $12/5 = 2.400$ | Superseded by GM everywhere |
| Montgomery (1971) | $5/2 = 2.500$ | Superseded |
| Heath-Brown (1979) ZD | $9/4 = 2.250$ | Superseded by Ivic/TTY |

## 5. Sensitivity Analysis

### Sensitivity of $\theta_{\mathrm{PNTALL}}$

The Ingham relation $\theta = 1 - 1/\|A\|_\infty$ gives

$$
\frac{d\theta}{d\|A\|_\infty} = \frac{1}{\|A\|_\infty^2} = \frac{13^2}{30^2} = \frac{169}{900} \approx 0.1878.
$$

This is the sole sensitivity coefficient. Reducing $\|A\|_\infty$ by $\delta$ improves $\theta$ by approximately $\delta \cdot 169/900$.

| $\|A\|_\infty$ | $\theta$ | $\Delta\theta$ | Interpretation |
|----------------|---------|----------------|---------------|
| $30/13 \approx 2.308$ | $17/30 \approx 0.567$ | $0$ | Current (GM) |
| $2.20$ | $0.545$ | $-0.021$ | Modest new LVE |
| $2.10$ | $0.524$ | $-0.043$ | Substantial new LVE |
| $2.00$ | $0.500$ | $-0.067$ | Density Hypothesis |

The gap from the current value to the Density Hypothesis target is $30/13 - 2 = 4/13 \approx 0.308$.

### Sensitivity of $\theta_{\mathrm{GAPSQUARE}}$

At the binding point $\sigma \approx 0.999$ (where $\alpha$ is maximized), the numerically computed sensitivities are:

$$
\frac{\partial\theta_{\mathrm{GS}}}{\partial A}\bigg|_{\sigma \approx 1} \approx -0.133, \qquad \frac{\partial\theta_{\mathrm{GS}}}{\partial B}\bigg|_{\sigma \approx 1} \approx +0.134.
$$

The leverage ratio is $|\partial\theta_{\mathrm{GS}}/\partial B| \;/\; |\partial\theta_{\mathrm{GS}}/\partial A| \approx 1.005$. The two levers are nearly equally effective.

## 6. The Role of $A^*(\sigma)$

**For $\theta_{\mathrm{PNTALL}}$.** The Ingham relation involves only $A(\sigma)$, not $A^*(\sigma)$. Improving the energy exponent has zero effect on the prime gap bound. The bottleneck is entirely in the large-value projection $\pi_{\sigma,\tau,\rho}(\mathcal{P})$.

**For $\theta_{\mathrm{GAPSQUARE}}$.** The Heath-Brown mean-square formula involves both $A(\sigma)$ and $B(\sigma) \geq A^*(\sigma)$. After Guth–Maynard, the current binding energy estimate is

$$
A^*(\sigma) \leq \frac{12}{4\sigma - 1} \qquad \text{on } [5/6, 1),
$$

from Heath-Brown (1979). At $\sigma \approx 0.999$, this gives $A^* \approx 4.01$ while $A \approx 0.14$, yielding $B/A \approx 28$. The function $\alpha(\sigma)$ dominates $\beta(\sigma)$ in this regime.

The structural consequence: Guth–Maynard decreased $A(\sigma)$ for $\sigma > 7/10$, widening the gap $B - A$ in the denominator of $\alpha$, but the numerator $B(1-\sigma) - 1$ also decreases as $\sigma \to 1$. The net effect is that $A$ and $A^*$ contribute approximately equally to $\theta_{\mathrm{GAPSQUARE}}$. Improving the 45-year-old Heath-Brown energy estimate would tighten $\theta_{\mathrm{GAPSQUARE}}$ but leave $\theta_{\mathrm{PNTALL}}$ unchanged.

## 7. Geometric Interpretation

### How GM reshaped $A(\sigma)$

In the $(\sigma, A(\sigma))$ plane, the best zero-density envelope has the shape of an asymmetric arch:

- **Rising limb** ($\sigma \in [1/2, \sigma^*]$): governed by Ingham, $A = 3/(2-\sigma)$.
- **Peak** ($\sigma = \sigma^*$): the cusp at $\|A\|_\infty$.
- **Falling limb** ($\sigma \in [\sigma^*, 1)$): governed by a sequence of estimates — GM, then Ivic, then TTY, then Bourgain-derived, then Pintz — each tighter than the last as $\sigma$ increases.

Before Guth–Maynard, the falling limb began with $A_{\mathrm{Hux}}(\sigma) = 12(1-\sigma)/5$, yielding a cusp at $\sigma^* = 5/7$ with height $12/5$. After Guth–Maynard, the GM curve $15/(5\sigma + 3)$ undercuts Huxley everywhere on $(1/2, 1)$. The cusp drops to height $30/13$ and shifts to $\sigma^* = 7/10$.

### How GM reshaped $\mathcal{P}$

At the level of the 5D polytope $\mathcal{P}$, Guth–Maynard contributes:

1. **Three LV half-spaces** in $(\sigma, \tau, \rho)$: the constraint $\rho \leq \max(2-2\sigma,\; 18/5-4\sigma,\; \tau + 12/5-4\sigma)$.
2. **Twenty iterated LV half-spaces** (parameter $K = 1, \ldots, 20$), giving progressively tighter bounds via the Guth–Maynard iteration.
3. **Three LVER half-spaces** in full 5D, coupling $\rho$, $\rho^*$, and $s$ via Lemma 10.18 of [GM24].

These shave the $\rho$-face of $\mathcal{P}$, tightening the LV projection $R_{\mathrm{LV}} = \pi_{\sigma,\tau,\rho}(\mathcal{P})$. The energy projection $R_{\mathrm{energy}} = \pi_{\sigma,\tau,\rho^*}(\mathcal{P})$ is essentially unchanged: the GM LVER constraints couple $\rho^*$ to $\rho$ through $s$, but the energy face was not the binding face before GM and remains non-binding after.

## 8. Roadmap for the Next Improvement

The cusp structure at $\sigma^* = 7/10$ determines the attack surface.

### Path A: Beat GM to the right of $\sigma = 7/10$

A new large-value estimate giving $A(\sigma) < 15/(5\sigma + 3)$ in a neighborhood of $\sigma = 7/10$ would lower the right limb of the arch. Since $A_{\mathrm{GM}}(7/10) = 30/13$ and $A_{\mathrm{GM}}'(7/10) = -75/(13/2)^2 = -300/169 \approx -1.775$, a small improvement $\varepsilon$ in the LVE near $\sigma = 7/10$ propagates as $\Delta\theta \approx \varepsilon \cdot 169/900$.

This requires a new decoupling or incidence-geometry argument that goes beyond the Guth–Maynard method in the $\sigma \approx 0.7$ regime.

### Path B: Beat Ingham to the left of $\sigma = 7/10$

The Ingham bound $A(\sigma) = 3/(2-\sigma)$ is 85 years old. It arises from the mean value theorem for Dirichlet polynomials and is essentially a second-moment bound. Improving it would require a sub-convexity-type estimate for zero-density — a fundamentally different kind of result from large-value estimates.

### Path C: Improve $A^*(\sigma)$

This would not affect $\theta_{\mathrm{PNTALL}}$ but would improve $\theta_{\mathrm{GAPSQUARE}}$. The binding energy estimate $A^* = 12/(4\sigma - 1)$ on $[5/6, 1)$ dates to Heath-Brown (1979). New additive energy estimates for Dirichlet polynomials — perhaps using the sum-product machinery developed since 2000 — could tighten the energy projection.

### Priority ranking

| Priority | Target | Effect on $\theta_{\mathrm{PNTALL}}$ | Effect on $\theta_{\mathrm{GAPSQUARE}}$ | Difficulty |
|----------|--------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------|
| 1 | New LVE near $\sigma = 0.70$ | Direct | Indirect | Extremely hard |
| 2 | Improve Ingham for $\sigma < 0.70$ | Direct | Indirect | Open for 85 years |
| 3 | New energy estimates | None | Direct | Hard but plausible |

The first two paths address the same cusp from opposite sides. Any improvement to either limb, however small, strictly decreases $\theta_{\mathrm{PNTALL}}$.

<<<<<<< HEAD
We verified computationally that the EXPDB pipeline has fully exploited the Guth-Maynard result for $\theta_{\mathrm{PNTALL}}$; no pipeline optimization changes the binding value $30/13$. The sole identified gap (stale exponent pairs in `bourgain_ep_to_zd`) affects only the $\theta_{\mathrm{GAPSQUARE}}$ computation and has been reported to the EXPDB maintainers.

## 9. Fine-Grained Sensitivity Map

### The effective radius

The Ingham relation $\theta = 1 - 1/\|A\|_\infty$ concentrates all sensitivity into a narrow band around $\sigma^*$. Define the *headroom* at $\sigma$ as $h(\sigma) := \|A\|_\infty - A(\sigma)$. An improvement of magnitude $\varepsilon$ in $A$ at $\sigma$ affects $\theta$ only if $h(\sigma) < \varepsilon$.

The following table gives the *effective radius* — the interval of $\sigma$ values within headroom $\varepsilon$ of the peak — for several improvement magnitudes:

| $\varepsilon$ | $\sigma$ range | Width | $\Delta\theta$ |
|---|---|---|---|
| $0.001$ | $[0.699, 0.700]$ | $0.001$ | $-0.000\,19$ |
| $0.005$ | $[0.698, 0.703]$ | $0.005$ | $-0.000\,94$ |
| $0.01$ | $[0.695, 0.705]$ | $0.011$ | $-0.001\,9$ |
| $0.02$ | $[0.689, 0.711]$ | $0.023$ | $-0.003\,8$ |
| $0.05$ | $[0.671, 0.729]$ | $0.057$ | $-0.009\,6$ |
| $0.10$ | $[0.641, 0.759]$ | $0.118$ | $-0.019\,6$ |

The band is remarkably narrow. An improvement of $\varepsilon = 0.01$ in $A$ needs to hold only on an interval of width $\approx 0.011$ centered at $\sigma = 7/10$. Outside this band, the headroom exceeds $\varepsilon$ and the improvement is invisible to $\theta$.

### Cusp geometry and attack surface

At the cusp $\sigma^* = 7/10$, the two binding curves have derivatives:

$$
\frac{d}{d\sigma}\!\left[\frac{3}{2-\sigma}\right]\bigg|_{\sigma=7/10} = \frac{3}{(13/10)^2} = \frac{300}{169} \approx +1.775,
$$

$$
\frac{d}{d\sigma}\!\left[\frac{15}{5\sigma+3}\right]\bigg|_{\sigma=7/10} = \frac{-75}{(13/2)^2} = \frac{-300}{169} \approx -1.775.
$$

The slopes are *exactly symmetric*: $|dA_{\mathrm{Ing}}/d\sigma| = |dA_{\mathrm{GM}}/d\sigma| = 300/169$. This means the cusp is a $V$-shaped notch with opening angle $2\arctan(169/300) \approx 58°$. To lower $\|A\|_\infty$ by $\varepsilon$, it suffices to beat the current bound on an interval of width

$$
\delta \approx \frac{\varepsilon}{300/169} = \frac{169\,\varepsilon}{300} \approx 0.563\,\varepsilon.
$$

The attack surface is small. A new bound that improves $A$ by $0.01$ at the single point $\sigma = 0.70$ need only extend over an interval of width $\approx 0.006$.

*Figure 2. Sensitivity $d\theta_{\mathrm{PNTALL}}/dA(\sigma)$ as a function of $\sigma$ (horizontal) and improvement magnitude $\varepsilon$ (vertical). The cone of nonzero sensitivity flares from the cusp at $\sigma = 0.70$. White boundary lines trace the $V$-shaped contour with slopes $\pm 300/169$. For small $\varepsilon$, only $\sigma \in [0.695, 0.705]$ contributes.*

### Sensitivity map for $\theta_{\mathrm{GAPSQUARE}}$

For the mean-square gap exponent, the $\alpha/\beta$ formulas create a completely different sensitivity landscape. At each $\sigma$, the partial derivatives of $\alpha$ with respect to $A$ and $B = A^*$ measure the leverage of each bound:

| $\sigma$ | $A$ | $B$ | $B/A$ | $\partial\alpha/\partial A$ | $\partial\alpha/\partial B$ | Dominant lever |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| $0.55$ | $2.07$ | $6.05$ | $2.9$ | $+0.217$ | $+0.009$ | $A$ (24:1) |
| $0.65$ | $2.22$ | $6.03$ | $2.7$ | $+0.153$ | $+0.031$ | $A$ (5:1) |
| $0.70$ | $2.31$ | $6.03$ | $2.6$ | $+0.117$ | $+0.045$ | $A$ (2.6:1) |
| $0.75$ | $2.22$ | $5.81$ | $2.6$ | $+0.071$ | $+0.069$ | Equal |
| $0.80$ | $1.87$ | $5.09$ | $2.7$ | $+0.003$ | $+0.121$ | $B$ (40:1) |
| $0.85$ | $1.76$ | $5.00$ | $2.8$ | $-0.048$ | $+0.140$ | $B$ (3:1) |
| $0.90$ | $1.50$ | $4.61$ | $3.1$ | $-0.111$ | $+0.175$ | $B$ (1.6:1) |
| $0.95$ | $1.09$ | $4.28$ | $3.9$ | $-0.154$ | $+0.185$ | $B$ (1.2:1) |

The crossover from $A$-dominated to $B$-dominated sensitivity occurs near $\sigma \approx 0.75$. Below this, tightening $A$ helps most; above it, tightening $B = A^*$ helps most. The two heat maps for $\theta_{\mathrm{PNTALL}}$ and $\theta_{\mathrm{GAPSQUARE}}$ are essentially disjoint: the prime gap exponent is controlled by $\sigma \approx 0.70$, while the mean-square exponent is controlled by $\sigma > 0.85$ — and there, the energy bound $B$ is the dominant lever.

![Sensitivity of alpha to A and B as functions of sigma, showing the crossover near sigma = 0.75 and the sign change of d(alpha)/dA near sigma = 0.80.](alpha_sensitivity.png)
*Figure 3. Partial derivatives $\partial\alpha/\partial A$ (blue) and $\partial\alpha/\partial B$ (red) as functions of $\sigma$. The crossover at $\sigma \approx 0.751$ separates $A$-dominant (left) from $B$-dominant (right) regimes. The zero crossing of $\partial\alpha/\partial A$ at $\sigma \approx 0.804$ marks where improving $A$ becomes counterproductive for $\theta_{\mathrm{GAPSQUARE}}$.*

Note that $\partial\alpha/\partial A$ changes sign near $\sigma \approx 0.80$. For $\sigma > 0.80$, *decreasing* $A$ actually *increases* $\alpha$ (and hence worsens $\theta_{\mathrm{GAPSQUARE}}$). This is because the $\alpha$ formula has $A$ in the denominator $B - A$: decreasing $A$ widens the gap $B - A$, which decreases $\alpha$ through the numerator but increases it through the denominator. The net sign depends on the local ratio $B/A$.

### The succession landscape

If someone lowers the cusp at $\sigma = 0.70$, the new $\|A\|_\infty$ is determined by the second-highest point of $A(\sigma)$. The succession of targets, ordered by decreasing $A$:

| Target | $\sigma$ range | Current peak $A$ | Gap from cusp | Binding source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1st (current) | $0.700$ | $30/13 \approx 2.308$ | $0$ | Ingham / GM |
| 2nd | $\sim 0.76$ | $\sim 2.21$ | $0.10$ | Ivic (2003) |
| 3rd | $\sim 0.77$ | $\sim 2.09$ | $0.22$ | Ivic (1979) / TTY |
| 4th | $\sim 0.80$ | $\sim 1.88$ | $0.43$ | Ivic (1980) |
| 5th | $\sim 0.88$ | $\sim 1.71$ | $0.59$ | Heath-Brown (1979) |
| 6th | $\sim 0.90$ | $\sim 1.50$ | $0.81$ | TTY (2024) |
| Final | all $\sigma$ | $2$ | $0.31$ | Density Hypothesis |

After the first improvement past GM, the second improvement would need to target a *different* $\sigma$ range ($\sigma \approx 0.76$) and a *different* constraint family (Ivic, not GM). The targets march rightward along $\sigma$ as the peak is lowered, each requiring a distinct analytical technique. Reaching the Density Hypothesis $\|A\|_\infty = 2$ requires beating *every* bound in the table — a sequence of progressively harder problems spanning the entire range $\sigma \in (1/2, 1)$.

The bottleneck migrates rightward with each improvement.*
